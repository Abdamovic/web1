	<p>Bandwidth was originally measured in bits per second and expressed as bps. However, todayâ€™s networks typically have much higher bandwidth than can be comfortably expressed by using such small units. Now it is common to see higher numbers that are denoted with metric prefixes, such as Mbps, (megabits per second), Gbps (gigabits per second), or Tbps (terabits per second).</p>
